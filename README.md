The Biconomy account package achieves this by providing a comprehensive set of methods that enable developers to effortlessly create UserOperations. Combined with the sophisticated backend infrastructure of the Biconomy platform, it ensures efficient and reliable transmission of these operations across EVM networks.

### Bundler

In the context of  (ERC4337), the concept of a bundler plays a central role in the infrastructure. This concept is integral to the operation of account abstraction across any network that utilizes the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 

Bundler infrastructure is designed and implemented in accordance with standardised specifications. This standardisation across all bundlers offers a significant advantage, particularly when it comes to interoperability with various tools and services, such as the Biconomy SDK.


### Paymaster

ERC4337, Account abstraction, introduces the concept of Paymasters. These specialised entities play a pivotal role in revolutionising the traditional gas payment system in EVM transactions. Paymasters, acting as third-party intermediaries, possess the capability to sponsor gas fees for an account, provided specific predefined conditions are satisfied.
